*Script for open develop tmux session*

  ## Description.

This script is made to quickly enable the development environment for python3.
The script assumes that the "poetry" program is used as the environment.
In order for the script to select the correct directory where projects are stored (in the form of directories), it must be specified manually at the beginning of the script.

  ## Plans for the future.

It is planned to add a session opening script to the vim tab, which will be individual for each project.
